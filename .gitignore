#COMMENTED OUT:
#         Originially contained with .gitignore supplied by the boilerplate
#         Commented out because the decision was made to ignore only what must
#         be ignored or what breaks the repo
#         IE: including the desktop.ini files broke the repo,
#             making it impossible to commit changes
